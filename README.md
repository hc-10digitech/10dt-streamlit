# Streamlit Development
Streamlit is a rapid application development environment: which means it is good at quickly developing applications. Streamlit mostly focuses on creating data analysis and data visualisation
applications. 

## What is this project?
This project is a multi-page streamlit web application. Each page has some base code (some more than others), that you will add to so that you can create a working page. 

## The pages
* Hello.py - This is the landing or home page of the application. It is a good place for you to check out how to put things like images, text, headings etc. onto a page. All the other pages are stored inside the pages folder
* 1_ðŸ“Š_Graph.py - This page is to demonstrate creating a graph. The sample code loads data from a CSV spreadsheet file for you, which you will use to create one (or more) graphs.
* 2_ðŸ“ˆ_Interactive_Graph.py - This page is for you to create an interactive graph. You might use code from the previous page to load a spreadsheet, or find one of your own with interesting data.
* 3_ðŸ›œ_Using_Live_Data.py - This page demonstrates how to gather data from a public API. APIs allow you to get easily processed data from live data sources.

## Where do I get help?
We will go through each of the different tools in class, but anytime you are looking to add additional functionality to your applications, the best place to go is the [Streamlit Documentation at https://docs.streamlit.io/](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
